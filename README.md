Universal Résumé Template
---------

Minimal and formal résumé (CV) website template for print, mobile, and desktop. The proportions are the same on the screen and paper. Built with amazing [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

[Letter Size Demo](https://universal-resume.netlify.app/) | [Multiple Pages Demo](https://universal-resume-pages.netlify.app/) | [A4 Size Demo](https://universal-resume-a4.netlify.app/) | [Mobile Demo](https://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Funiversal-resume-pages.netlify.app%2F)

**How to print or save as PDF?**  
In Chrome, Right-click → Print. In Firefox, File → Print. More info [here](#printing).

**Does it support A4 and Letter paper sizes?**  
Yes. Replace every `-letter` with `-a4`, and uncomment specified code blocks. More info [here](#a4-size-variant).

**Why it’s made?**  
I couldn’t find any formal or professional résumé (CV) website with good typography that is optimized for the Web, print, PDF, and mobile. Also, researching what recruiters want, my priorities were fast scanning time and all content to fit on one page.

How to run it
---------

Navigate to the base directory:

```
cd universal-resume
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
npm run serve
```

Only generate CSS that is used on the page which results in a much smaller file size:

```
npm run build
```

Starting Point
---------

`docs/index.html` is the main content file. By copying HTML: add pages, sec­tions, subsection, and other parts.

`npm run build` will make **docs** directory ready for drag-n-drop to, for example, https://app.netlify.com/drop (free registration required beforehand). Also, with additionally running `git add docs/styles.css -f` and committing changes, it’s ready for the push to GitHub and integration with GitHub Pages. It may take some time for changes to occur. GitHub Pages are set by configuring `Settings → Options → GitHub Pages → Source → /docs` (free for public repos).

Tailwind CSS
---------

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. It has great [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

Custom CSS
---------

Code from `tailwind.config.js` and `tailwind.css` transpiles to `docs/style.css`. Default Tailwind CSS is overwritten or extended with `tailwind.config.js`.

Here is the default tailwind config: [defaultConfig.stub.js](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js), and here’s the additional information about it from the Tailwind documentation: [theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme/#app).

If you want to change CSS in the classical way, add a class to the HTML element and write CSS inside `tailwind.css`.

Balanced Columns
---------

Removing `col-fill-auto` class will make both columns equally tall. Moreover, removing `md:h-letter` and `md:h-letter-col` classes will eliminate fixed proportions of the letter or A4 page — thereby removing unnecessary vertical space when displaying short columns.

A4 Size Variant
---------

Change the default (letter) size to A4:

**1.** Inside `docs/index.html`, replace every `-letter` with `-a4`.

**2.** Inside `tailwind.config.js`, uncomment code block below `/* For A4 size */` and then comment code block below `/* For Letter size */`

**3.** Inside `tailwind.css`, comment code below `/* For Letter size */` and uncomment code below `/* For A4 size */`

**Important:** Too much content on one page will break the page in the form of additional columns.

Printing
---------

### Chrome

Right-click → Print.  
Also, choose the **Save as PDF** option if needed.

By expanding **More Settings**, change **Page Size** to A4 or Letter.

### Firefox

File → Print.

Choose A4 or Letter size by navigating to **Properties → Advanced → Paper Size**.

### Adobe Acrobat Reader

File → Print.

By clicking on the **Page Setup** button, you are taken to the window with A4 and Letter options.

Blocking Search Engines
---------

Disable search engine indexing by adding the following code to the `<head>`:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```

Language Support
---------

With [FiraGO](https://github.com/bBoxType/FiraGO) typeface, this résumé supports the following scrips: Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Vietnamese, Arabic, Thai, Georgian, Devanagari, and Hebrew.

If you want to significantly speed up font loading time, find out what fonts you are using (under developer tools network panel) and add them to the `head` like so:

```html
<link rel="preload" href="./fonts/FiraGO-Regular.latin.woff2" as="font" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
